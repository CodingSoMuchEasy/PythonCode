Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) also known as Highest Common Factor (HCF)
The GCD of two integers a and b is the largest number that divides both of a and b without any remainder.

Using simple function

def findgcd(a,b):
    if(a==0):
        return b
    if(b==0):
        return a
    if (a!=0 and b!=0):
        while (b!=0):
            r=a%b
            a=b
            b=r 
    return a
    
x=int(input("Enter first value: ")) 
y=int(input("Enter second value: ")) 
print("GCD(",x,",",y,") is:", findgcd(x,y))



Using Recursion:

def findgcd(a, b):
    if(b == 0):
        return a
    else:
        return findgcd(b, a % b)

print("The gcd of 18 and 45 is : ", findgcd(18,45))
